A personal collection of my favourite wallpapers, to easily transfer between devices.
To download all wallpapers to hyprlock wallpaper folder:
`git clone https://github.com/Matanlo/Wallpapers/ ~/.config/hyprlock/wallpapers/`
To update your wallpapers to the current status of the github repository:
1. `cd ~/.config/hyprlock/wallpapers/`
2. `git pull`
3. `git status` to check for errors.
